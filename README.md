## Background

The business team requires a continuous feed of user data generated by RandomUser with the following specifications:

1. Data Source: https://randomuser.me/api
2. Required Information:
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Gender
    * Age
    * Country
    * Email
3. Frequency: One new user data entry every minute
4. Data Segmentation: The user data should be divided into two categories based on age:
    * Users with age greater than or equal to 30
    * Users with age less than 30
5. Data Format: The data should be provided in a tabular format, preferably in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.

In summary, the business team requires a continuous stream of user data from the RandomUser source, delivered every minute in CSV format, and categorized by age into two groups: age >= 30 and age < 30.
